## Description
This project was created for the Udacity Front-End Develop Nanodegree. 

## Project Instructions
This project includes a static webpage that needs to be converted into a mobile-ready web application. The webpage needs to include accessibility features including screen reader use. It also needs to be responsive on different sized displays. We added a service worker to add offline capability for users. 

## How to Run the Application
To run the application, you need to follow these steps:
1. Open the application [here](https://tlanetterose.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-tlp/)
2. Run the application locally
	* Clone the file to your Git Desktop, download the .zip file, or clone my project using your command terminal. 
	`$ git clone https://tlanetterose.github.io/mws-restaurant-stage-tlp.git`
	* In this folder, start up a simple HTTP server to serve up the site files on your local computer. Python has some simple tools to do this, and you don't even need to know Python. For most people, it's already installed on your computer.
	* In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.
	* With your server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`.
